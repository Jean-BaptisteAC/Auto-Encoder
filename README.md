# Auto-Encoder
This project is about the construction of a Variable Auto Encoder (VAE) using the basic MNIST data set. 
The goal of an Auto Encoder is to encode an image within a very low-dimentional space in order to really grasp the specifications of the data set features.

Autoencoders can be used for anomaly classification, dimensionnality reduction, preprocessing, and for merging different images.
